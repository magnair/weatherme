# Alerting icons

This is a set of icons to be used with the MetAlerts API.
The icons are finished, but the filenames and symbol codes in MetAlerts are
not finished yet. In the mean time you can download alerting icons in SVG format
(which can be converted to PNG)
from the [NRK GitHub page](https://github.com/nrkno/yr-warning-icons).

## Variants

Each warning icon includes a yellow, orange, and red variant.
You can find descriptions of what the icons represent on the Yr help pages
in [English](https://hjelp.yr.no/hc/en-us/articles/360014052634)
and [Norwegian](https://hjelp.yr.no/hc/no/articles/360014052634).
