# Copilot Instructions for WeatherMe Project

- Always review the project structure and existing code before making changes.
- Follow established coding conventions and file organization (TypeScript/React for frontend, C#/ASP.NET Core for backend).
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages and document significant changes in the README if needed.
- Write modular, maintainable code and prefer reusing existing components/services.
- For backend changes, ensure API contracts are consistent and update or add tests in WeatherMe.Api.Tests.
- For frontend changes, keep UI/UX consistent with the current design and update styles in the appropriate CSS files.
- Use environment variables and configuration files for secrets and deployment-specific settings.
- Validate all changes by running tests and checking for build errors before submitting.
- Document new features, APIs, or architectural decisions in the README or a dedicated documentation file.
- Communicate any uncertainties or assumptions in comments or documentation to help future contributors.
